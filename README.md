# Emotional vulnerabilities

## Anger

_Remember that it is not he who reviles or strikes you who insults you, but your opinion that these things are insulting. So when anyone makes you angry, know that it is your own thought that has angered you._

- _Epictetus, Enchiridion, Chapter 20_ [⤴](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0557.tlg002.perseus-eng1:20)

> When someone triggers your anger, it's important to acknowledge that this reaction originates within your own cognitive and emotional framework. This may highlight areas where your understanding and intellectual shortcomings affect your ability to respond calmly and rationally.

_Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him._

- _Epictetus, Discourses, Book 2, Chapter 18_ [⤴](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0557.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2)

## Solitude

_If you are lonely when you're alone, you are in bad company._

- _Jean-Paul Sartre, L'Être et le Néant, 1943, Part 1, Chapter 2_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/beingnothingness0000unse)

> When one feels lonely even in solitude, it reveals a disconnection from one’s own thoughts and feelings. This suggests that the discomfort isn’t solely about the absence of others, but also about how external distractions may prevent one from finding comfort and meaning within oneself.

_See that void above our heads? That's God. Silence is God, absence is God. God is the solitude of men._

- _Jean-Paul Sartre, Le Diable et le Bon Dieu, 1951, Third Act_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/lediableetlebond0000sart)

## Intelligence

_If you can't explain something to a six-year-old, you really don't understand it yourself._ [^1]

- _Ronald W. Clark, Einstein: His Life and Times, 1972, Page 418_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/einstein00rona)

> Intelligence isn’t measured by the sheer amount of knowledge one accumulates; rather, it’s about how effectively that knowledge is applied. It’s only when we face our own lack of understanding that we realize our knowledge is just one piece of a much larger puzzle and that intelligence is the framework of that puzzle.

_As God, my father, says, it is only the way it is until we discover the new way it is, and then that is the way it is until we discover the new way it is, and so it goes until the world is no longer flat, electricity lights the night, and shoes are no longer tied with ribbons._

- _Alasdair Gray, Poor Things, 1992, Chapter 14_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/poorthingsepisod00gray)

# Existential questioning

## Death

_I have to die.  
If it is now, well then I die now;  
If later, then now I will take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived – and dying I will tend to later._

- _Epictetus, Discourses, 1.1.32, Trans. Massimo Pigliucci_ [⤴](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.1.one.html)

> Lamenting over the inevitability of death serves no purpose and creates nothing but unnecessary distraction. Instead, cultivate your obsession with a sense of gratitude and certainty. Death is a certainty, but so is the opportunity to live fully until that time comes.

_So death, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, death is not with us; but when death comes, then we do not exist. It does not concern either the living or the dead, since for the former it is not, and the latter are no more._

- _Epicurus, Letter to Menoeceus, 3_ [⤴](https://users.manchester.edu/Facstaff/SSNaragon/Online/texts/316/Epicurus,%20LetterMenoeceus.pdf)

## Universe

_On a cosmic scale, our lifespan is insignificant, and yet this brief period during which we appear on the world’s stage is where all questions of significance stem._

- _Paul Ricœur, Le temps raconté, Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale, 1983, 4, Page 440_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/tempsetrcit0000ricu)

> While the cosmos may remain indifferent to ourselves, we humans, in our vanity, try to place ourselves at the center of infinity, creating stories and meanings to assert our significance. Despite our grand narratives, the universe remains unmoved, and the stars continue their quiet, eternal glow.

_Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives._

- _Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space, 1994, Page 8_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/palebluedot00carl)

## Consciousness

_'Most men will not swim before they are able to.' Is that not witty? Naturally, they won't swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they wont think. They are made for life, not for thought. Yes, and he who thinks, what’s more, he who makes thought his business, he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one day he will drown._

- _Hermann Hesse, Der Steppenwolf, 1927, Page 10_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/steppenwolf0000hess)

> We are grounded beings, thriving on solid earth and direct experience, not on abstract musings. Those who immerse themselves in relentless introspection might achieve great insights, but in doing so, they risk losing touch with the very essence of living that keeps them anchored.

_Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced._

- _J. J. Van Der  Leeuw, The Conquest of Illusion, 1928, 4, Page 9_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/conquestofillusi0000jjva)

# Fundamental development

## Resilience

_He who fights with monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you._

- _Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good & Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future, 1886, Aphorism 146_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/beyondgoodevilpr1909niet)

> Don't men embark on the path of war to halt its march or forestall its coming? What can be said to a man who has killed when he is already corrupted by his actions? What differentiates human beings is their ability to refrain from their instincts; one who lets himself be guided by his instincts puts on a leash and becomes a captive of his own making.

_<sup>13</sup> Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. <sup>14</sup> But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it._

_<sup>15</sup> I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. <sup>16</sup> And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. <sup>17</sup> As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me._

- _Holy Bible, New International Version, 1973_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/holybiblenewinte0000unse)
	- _Matthew 7:13-14_
	- _Romans 7:15-17_

## Virtue

_There's nothing outside you that can make you better, stronger, richer, faster or smarter. It's all inside you. Don't look for anything outside yourself._

- _Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings, 空の巻, 1645, Book 5_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/bookoffiverings0000miya)

> Our body and muscles are tools that can be cultivated through discipline and effort, much like sharpening the mind with knowledge and practice. This perspective nurtures a sense of accomplishment, as the focus shifts from external accumulation to internal contentment. What lies beyond the palms of one’s hands must not pervert one’s self, for the sole dominion we possess is over our own being.

_When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves._

- _Viktor E. Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning, 2, Page 112_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/manssearchformea0000fran)

## Physique

_Man must remake himself. And he cannot remake himself without suffering. For he is both the marble and the sculptor. In order to uncover his true visage he must shatter his own substance with heavy blows of his hammer. He will not submit to such treatment unless driven by necessity. While surrounded by the comfort, the beauty, and the mechanical marvels engendered by technology, he does not understand how urgent is this operation. He fails to realize that he is degenerating._ [^2]

- _Alexis Carrel, Man The Unknown, 1935, Chapter 8, 1_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.168284/)

> Our body is the only true instrument we possess, both precious and fragile; it is, until proven otherwise, irreplaceable. When we lose control over our body and stop paying attention to its needs and signals, we risk becoming disconnected from it. This disconnection can lead to gradual neglect. Fueled by the obsession with the artifices of modern life and its excesses, we end up ignoring these subtle signals, leading us to lose an essential part of ourselves, the one that constitutes our mental and physical balance.

_Besides, it is a disgrace to grow old through sheer carelessness before seeing what manner of man you may become by developing your bodily strength and beauty to their highest limit. But you cannot see that, if you are careless; for it will not come of its own accord._

- _Xenophon, Memorabilia, Book 3, Chapter 12_ [⤴](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg002.perseus-eng1:3.12)

## Gratitude

_Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world._

- _Miyamoto Musashi, The Way of Walking Alone, 獨行道, 1645, Precept 4_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/fritzkeys-dokkodo-musashi)

> Individuals tend to overestimate their own significance, sometimes imagining it as big as mountains can be. In their foolishness, they might find themselves lost on the trail of life. Reevaluating the scale of existence is truly the leading path to understanding the realm to which we belong. We will invariably remain smaller than a mountain, eternally dominated by the vastness of the planets, and perpetually distant from the farthest star.

_The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts. So, for instance, if you are constantly contemplating the nature of the universe, you will come to embody its attributes. Similarly, if you are preoccupied with the nature of the good, you will become good. In essence, the character of your soul reflects the nature of your thoughts._

- _Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, Book 5, Chapter 16_ [⤴](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Meditations_of_the_Emperor_Marcus_Antoninus/Book_5)

_Preoccupied with a single leaf, you won’t see the tree. Preoccupied with a single tree, you’ll miss the entire forest._

- _Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings, 風の巻, 1645, Book 4_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/bookoffiverings0000miya)

> As our hearts open to the richness of our shared human experience, we find ourselves woven into a larger, interconnected tapestry, where each thread—no matter how seemingly insignificant—contributes to the grand, intricate design of existence.

_What if the other living creatures were the ones who taught humans?  
What if the horses taught them how to run?  
The frogs how to swim?  
The plants how to wait?_

- _André-Georges Haudricourt, Pratiques de la Culture des Fruits, 1987, 169_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/latechnologiesci0000haud)
