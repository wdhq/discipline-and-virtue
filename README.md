# Emotional vulnerabilities

## Anger

_So when any one makes you angry, know that it is your own thoughts that has angered you._

- _Epictetus, Enchiridion, Chapter 20_ [⤴](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0557.tlg002.perseus-eng1:20)

> When someone triggers your anger, it's important to acknowledge that this reaction originates within your own cognitive and emotional framework. This may highlight areas where your understanding and intellectual shortcomings affect your ability to respond calmly and rationally.

_Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him._

- _Epictetus, Discourses, Book 2, Chapter 18_ [⤴](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0557.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2)

## Solitude

_If you are lonely when you're alone, you are in bad company._

- _Jean-Paul Sartre, L'Être et le Néant, 1943, Part 1, Chapter 2_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/beingnothingness0000unse)

> When one feels lonely even in solitude, it reveals a disconnection from one’s own thoughts and feelings. This suggests that the discomfort isn’t solely about the absence of others, but also about how external distractions may prevent one from finding comfort and meaning within oneself.

_See that void above our heads? That's God. Silence is God, absence is God. God is the solitude of men._

- _Jean-Paul Sartre, Le Diable et le Bon Dieu, 1951, Third Act_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/lediableetlebond0000sart)

## Intelligence

_If you can't explain something to a six-year-old, you really don't understand it yourself._

- _Ronald W. Clark, Einstein: His Life and Times, 1972, Page 418_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/einstein00rona) <sup>[Notice](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Misattributed)</sup> 

> Intelligence isn’t measured by the sheer amount of knowledge one accumulates; rather, it’s about how effectively that knowledge is applied. It’s only when we face our own lack of understanding that we realize our knowledge is just one piece of a much larger puzzle and that intelligence is the framework of that puzzle.

_As God, my father, says, it is only the way it is until we discover the new way it is, and then that is the way it is until we discover the new way it is, and so it goes until the world is no longer flat, electricity lights the night, and shoes are no longer tied with ribbons._

- _Alasdair Gray, Poor Things, 1992, Chapter 14_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/poorthingsepisod00gray)

# Existential questioning

## Death

_I have to die.  
If it is now, well then I die now;  
If later, then now I will take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived – and dying I will tend to later._

- _Epictetus, Discourses, 1.1.32, Trans. Massimo Pigliucci_ [⤴](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.1.one.html)

> Lamenting over the inevitability of death serves no purpose and creates nothing but unnecessary distraction. Instead, cultivate your obsession with a sense of gratitude and certainty. Death is a certainty, but so is the opportunity to live fully until that time comes.

_So death, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, death is not with us; but when death comes, then we do not exist. It does not concern either the living or the dead, since for the former it is not, and the latter are no more._

- _Epicurus, Letter to Menoeceus, 3_ [⤴](https://users.manchester.edu/Facstaff/SSNaragon/Online/texts/316/Epicurus,%20LetterMenoeceus.pdf)

## Universe

_On a cosmic scale, our lifespan is insignificant, and yet this brief period during which we appear on the world’s stage is where all questions of significance stem._

- _Paul Ricœur, Le temps raconté, Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale, 1983, 4, Page 440_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/tempsetrcit0000ricu)

> While the cosmos may remain indifferent to ourselves, we humans, in our vanity, try to place ourselves at the center of infinity, creating stories and meanings to assert our significance. Despite our grand narratives, the universe remains unmoved, and the stars continue their quiet, eternal glow.

_Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives._

- _Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space, 1994, Page 8_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/palebluedot00carl)

## Consciousness

_'Most men will not swim before they are able to.' Is that not witty? Naturally, they won't swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they wont think. They are made for life, not for thought. Yes, and he who thinks, what’s more, he who makes thought his business, he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one day he will drown._

- _Hermann Hesse, Der Steppenwolf, 1927, Page 10_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/steppenwolf0000hess)

> We are grounded beings, thriving on solid earth and direct experience, not on abstract musings. Those who immerse themselves in relentless introspection might achieve great insights, but in doing so, they risk losing touch with the very essence of living that keeps them anchored.

_Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced._

- _J. J. Van Der  Leeuw, The Conquest of Illusion, 1928, 4, Page 9_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/conquestofillusi0000jjva)

# Fundamental development

## Virtue

_There's nothing outside you that can make you better, stronger, richer, faster or smarter. It's all inside you. Don't look for anything outside yourself._

- _Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings, 空の巻, 1645, Book 5_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/bookoffiverings0000miya)

> Our body and muscles are tools that can be cultivated through discipline and effort, much like sharpening the mind with knowledge and practice. This perspective nurtures a sense of accomplishment, as the focus shifts from external accumulation to internal contentment. What lies beyond the palms of one’s hands must not pervert one’s self, for the sole dominion we possess is over our own being.

_When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves._

- _Viktor E. Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning, 2, Page 112_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/manssearchformea0000fran)

## Gratitude

_Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world._

- _Miyamoto Musashi, The Way of Walking Alone, 獨行道, 1645, Precept 4_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/fritzkeys-dokkodo-musashi)

> Individuals tend to overestimate their own significance, sometimes imagining it as big as mountains can be. In their foolishness, they might find themselves lost on the trail of life. Reevaluating the scale of existence is truly the leading path to understanding the realm to which we belong.

_Preoccupied with a single leaf, you won’t see the tree. Preoccupied with a single tree, you’ll miss the entire forest._

- _Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings, 風の巻, 1645, Book 4_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/bookoffiverings0000miya)

> As our hearts open to the richness of our shared human experience, we find ourselves woven into a larger, interconnected tapestry, where each thread—no matter how seemingly insignificant—contributes to the grand, intricate design of existence.

_What if the other living creatures were the ones who taught humans?  
What if the horses taught them how to run?  
The frogs how to swim?  
The plants how to wait?_

- _André-Georges Haudricourt, Pratiques de la Culture des Fruits, 1987, 169_ [⤴](https://archive.org/details/latechnologiesci0000haud)
